    MULTIPLICATIVE APPROACH IS SUPERIOR FOR REGIME FEATURES
    
    Why:
    • Regime features are inherently contextual modifiers
    • 2-3x lift ratios indicate strong regime-dependent effects
    • Multiplicative approach captures this context dependency
    • Allows gradual adjustment rather than binary on/off
    • Maintains interpretability while adding sophistication
    
    Implementation:
    • Use BOTH standalone (for ML) and multiplicative (for trading)
    • Start with crisis_amplifier and btc_flight_amplifier
    • Monitor performance and gradually add other multipliers
    • Keep standalone features as fallback and for analysis
    
    Expected Outcome:
    • Better risk-adjusted returns through regime awareness
    • Improved position sizing during extreme market conditions
    • Enhanced signal quality during favorable regimes
    • Reduced losses during unfavorable regimes
