##  Key Findings Relevant to Your System

### 1. **Quantile-Based Approach Validation**
**Their Finding**: Quantile regression with deep learning outperforms traditional point prediction methods for Bitcoin price forecasting.

**Your System Connection**: 
- **Validates your Q50-centric approach** - You're already using quantile-based signals (Q10, Q50, Q90)
- **Confirms asymmetric payoff capture** - Your system's 7.04% win rate with positive returns aligns with quantile advantages
- **Supports multi-quantile modeling** - Your `MultiQuantileModel` is on the right track

### 2. **LSTM + Quantile Regression Architecture**
**Their Approach**: Combines LSTM temporal modeling with quantile regression for uncertainty quantification.

**Potential Enhancement for Your System**:
```python
# Current: LightGBM Multi-Quantile
# Potential: LSTM-Quantile hybrid for temporal patterns

class LSTMQuantileModel:
    def __init__(self, quantiles=[0.1, 0.5, 0.9]):
        self.quantiles = quantiles
        self.lstm_layers = # temporal feature extraction
        self.quantile_heads = # separate heads for each quantile
    
    def predict_with_uncertainty(self, sequence):
        # Returns Q10, Q50, Q90 with temporal context
        pass
```

### 3. **Uncertainty Quantification**
**Their Innovation**: Uses quantile predictions to measure prediction uncertainty and confidence intervals.

**Your System Enhancement Opportunity**:
- **Current**: You use spread (Q90-Q10) for uncertainty
- **Enhancement**: Could add temporal uncertainty from LSTM patterns
- **Application**: Dynamic threshold adjustment based on prediction confidence

### 4. **Multi-Step Prediction**
**Their Method**: Predicts multiple future time horizons using quantile regression.

**Your System Connection**:
- **Current**: Single-step prediction with regime awareness
- **Opportunity**: Multi-step quantile predictions for better position sizing
- **Integration**: Could enhance your `train_meta_wrapper.py` approach

    """
    # Rolling quantile momentum
    df['q50_momentum_3'] = df['q50'].rolling(3).apply(lambda x: x.iloc[-1] - x.iloc[0])
    df['q50_momentum_6'] = df['q50'].rolling(6).apply(lambda x: x.iloc[-1] - x.iloc[0])
    
    # Quantile spread dynamics
    df['spread_momentum'] = (df['q90'] - df['q10']).rolling(3).apply(lambda x: x.iloc[-1] - x.iloc[0])
    
    # Quantile convergence/divergence
    df['quantile_convergence'] = df['q50'].rolling(6).std()
    
    return df
```

### Enhancement 2: Uncertainty-Aware Position Sizing
```python
def uncertainty_aware_position_sizing(q10, q50, q90, base_size=0.1):
    """

    """
    # Prediction uncertainty (wider spread = less certain)
    uncertainty = (q90 - q10) / abs(q50) if abs(q50) > 0 else float('inf')
    
    # Confidence-adjusted position size
    confidence_multiplier = 1.0 / (1.0 + uncertainty)
    
    # Direction strength (how far Q50 is from neutral)
    direction_strength = abs(q50)
    
    return base_size * confidence_multiplier * direction_strength
```

### Enhancement 3: Multi-Horizon Quantile Prediction
```python
def multi_horizon_quantile_prediction(model, features, horizons=[1, 3, 6]):
    """
    Predict quantiles for multiple time horizons
    """
    predictions = {}
    
    for horizon in horizons:
        # Adjust features for different prediction horizons
        horizon_features = adjust_features_for_horizon(features, horizon)
        
        # Get quantile predictions
        preds = model.predict(horizon_features)
        predictions[f'h{horizon}'] = {
            'q10': preds['quantile_0.10'],
            'q50': preds['quantile_0.50'], 
            'q90': preds['quantile_0.90']
