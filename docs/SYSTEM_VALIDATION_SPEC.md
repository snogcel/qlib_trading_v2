# System Validation & Testing Specification

## Objective

Create a comprehensive validation framework that ensures every component of our trading system meets professional standards for explainability, robustness, and performance.

## ðŸ“‹ Validation Framework Components

### 1. **Economic Logic Validation**

Every feature and rule must pass economic sense checks:

#### Requirements:
- [ ] **Supply/Demand Rationale**: Clear explanation of why this creates trading edge
- [ ] **Chart Explainability**: Can be visualized and explained on price charts  
- [ ] **Market Microstructure**: Accounts for real trading conditions
- [ ] **Regime Awareness**: Behavior makes sense across different market conditions

#### Implementation:
```python
def validate_economic_logic(feature_name, feature_data, explanation):
    """
    Validate that a feature has sound economic reasoning
    
    Args:
        feature_name: Name of the feature
        feature_data: Feature values
        explanation: Economic rationale
    
    Returns:
        ValidationResult with pass/fail and reasoning
    """
    pass
```

### 2. **Statistical Validation**

Rigorous statistical testing of all components:

#### Requirements:
- [ ] **Time-series aware cross-validation**: No look-ahead bias
- [ ] **Out-of-sample testing**: Performance on unseen data
- [ ] **Regime robustness**: Works across bull/bear/sideways markets
- [ ] **Feature stability**: Predictive power persists over time

#### Implementation:
```python
def validate_statistical_significance(feature, returns, test_periods):
    """
    Test statistical significance of feature-return relationship
    
    Returns:
        - Correlation significance
        - Information coefficient
        - Regime-specific performance
        - Stability over time
    """
    pass
```

### 3. **Performance Validation**

Ensure changes maintain or improve risk-adjusted returns:

#### Requirements:
- [ ] **Sharpe ratio maintenance**: Must maintain â‰¥1.327 Sharpe
- [ ] **Drawdown control**: Max drawdown â‰¤15%
- [ ] **Trade frequency**: Sufficient opportunities (>1000 trades/year)
- [ ] **Transaction cost awareness**: Net of realistic costs

#### Implementation:
```python
def validate_performance_impact(old_system, new_system, benchmark_sharpe=1.327):
    """
    Compare performance of system changes
    
    Returns:
        - Performance comparison
        - Risk metrics comparison  
        - Trade frequency analysis
        - Statistical significance of improvement
    """
    pass
```

### 4. **Feature Quality Validation**

Systematic evaluation of feature engineering:

#### Requirements:
- [ ] **Predictive power**: Significant correlation with future returns
- [ ] **Low correlation**: Not redundant with existing features
- [ ] **Stability**: Consistent behavior over time
- [ ] **Interpretability**: Clear business meaning

#### Implementation:
```python
def validate_feature_quality(new_feature, existing_features, returns):
    """
    Comprehensive feature quality assessment
    
    Returns:
        - Predictive power metrics
        - Correlation with existing features
        - Stability analysis
        - Economic interpretation
    """
    pass
```
