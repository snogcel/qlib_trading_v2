## ðŸ“‹ Phase 1: Temporal Quantile Features (Week 1)

### Objective
Add LSTM-inspired temporal patterns to existing LightGBM pipeline without disrupting core architecture.

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Temporal Momentum Features**
  - Q50 momentum (3-period, 6-period)
  - Spread momentum (Q90-Q10 dynamics)
  - Quantile convergence/divergence patterns

- [ ] **Integration Points**
  - Add to `src/features/regime_features.py`
  - Integrate with existing feature pipeline
  - Maintain compatibility with current data loaders

- [ ] **Validation**
  - Backtest with temporal features added
  - Compare against 1.327 Sharpe baseline
  - Ensure no performance regression

### Success Criteria
- Features integrate cleanly with existing pipeline
- Sharpe ratio maintained or improved (â‰¥1.327)
- No increase in max drawdown (â‰¤-11.77%)
- Feature importance analysis shows temporal value

### Code Structure
```python
# Add to src/features/regime_features.py
def add_temporal_quantile_features(df):
    """Add research-inspired temporal quantile features"""
    # Q50 momentum patterns
    df['q50_momentum_3'] = df['q50'].rolling(3).apply(lambda x: x.iloc[-1] - x.iloc[0])
    df['q50_momentum_6'] = df['q50'].rolling(6).apply(lambda x: x.iloc[-1] - x.iloc[0])
    
    # Spread dynamics
    df['spread_momentum'] = (df['q90'] - df['q10']).rolling(3).apply(lambda x: x.iloc[-1] - x.iloc[0])
    
    # Quantile stability
    df['quantile_convergence'] = df['q50'].rolling(6).std()
    
    return df
```

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 2: Uncertainty-Aware Position Sizing (Week 2)

### Objective
Enhance Kelly criterion position sizing with formal uncertainty quantification from quantile predictions.

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Uncertainty Metrics**
  - Prediction confidence from quantile spread
  - Temporal uncertainty from rolling patterns
  - Regime-adjusted uncertainty scaling

- [ ] **Position Sizing Enhancement**
  - Integrate uncertainty into Kelly calculation
  - Dynamic position limits based on confidence
  - Regime-aware uncertainty adjustments

- [ ] **Integration Points**
  - Enhance `src/features/position_sizing.py`
  - Update backtesting engine to use new sizing
  - Maintain existing regime multiplier logic

### Success Criteria
- Uncertainty metrics correlate with prediction accuracy
- Position sizing reduces risk during uncertain periods
- Overall risk-adjusted returns improve
- System remains stable across market regimes

### Code Structure
```python
# Enhance src/features/position_sizing.py
def uncertainty_aware_kelly_sizing(q10, q50, q90, vol_risk, regime_multiplier):
    """Kelly sizing with uncertainty quantification"""
    # Prediction uncertainty
    uncertainty = (q90 - q10) / max(abs(q50), 0.001)
    confidence_multiplier = 1.0 / (1.0 + uncertainty)
    
    # Base Kelly calculation
    base_size = calculate_kelly_base(q50, vol_risk)
    
    # Apply uncertainty and regime adjustments
    final_size = base_size * confidence_multiplier * regime_multiplier
    
    return final_size.clip(0.01, 0.5)
```

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 3: LSTM-Quantile Exploration (Weeks 3-4)

### Objective
Develop and test LSTM-Quantile hybrid model as potential enhancement to LightGBM approach.

### Implementation Tasks

- Quantile predictions show temporal pattern capture
- Performance matches or exceeds LightGBM baseline
- Computational overhead acceptable for production

### Code Structure
```python
# New file: src/models/lstm_quantile.py
class LSTMQuantileModel:
    def __init__(self, quantiles=[0.1, 0.5, 0.9], sequence_length=24):
        self.quantiles = quantiles
        self.sequence_length = sequence_length
        # LSTM + Quantile regression architecture
    
    def predict_with_temporal_context(self, features):
        # Returns quantile predictions with temporal patterns
        pass
```
