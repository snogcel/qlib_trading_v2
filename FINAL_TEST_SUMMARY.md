```

## 🔧 Key Features Validated

### Mathematical Correctness
- ✅ Vol_risk = vol_raw² (variance calculation)
- ✅ Enhanced info ratio = |Q50| / sqrt(market_variance + prediction_variance)
- ✅ Regime thresholds at 30th/70th/90th percentiles
- ✅ Interaction features = regime_flag × Q50

### Economic Logic
- ✅ Transaction cost filtering (5 bps = 0.0005)
- ✅ Economic significance = expected_value > transaction_cost
- ✅ Adaptive thresholds based on market regimes
- ✅ Risk-adjusted signal quality

### Signal Generation
- ✅ Q50-centric directional logic
- ✅ LONG when tradeable & Q50 > 0
- ✅ SHORT when tradeable & Q50 < 0
- ✅ HOLD when not tradeable

### Regime Awareness
- ✅ Low volatility: 30% threshold reduction
- ✅ High volatility: 40% threshold increase
- ✅ Extreme volatility: 80% threshold increase
- ✅ Momentum regime identification
