## Test Data Generation

### Realistic Market Data Fixture
The test suite uses a sophisticated data generation approach:

```python
# Volatility regime simulation
base_vol = np.random.uniform(0.005, 0.02, n)
vol_regime_factor = np.random.choice([0.5, 1.0, 2.0], n, p=[0.7, 0.2, 0.1])
vol_raw = base_vol * vol_regime_factor

# Q50 correlation with volatility regimes
q50_base = np.random.normal(0, 0.008, n)
q50 = q50_base * vol_regime_factor * 0.5  # Stronger signals in high vol

# Spread correlation with volatility
spread_base = np.random.uniform(0.01, 0.03, n)
spread = spread_base * vol_regime_factor
```

### Mock Function Implementation
Comprehensive mock of `q50_regime_aware_signals` function:
- Vol_risk calculation (variance)
- Regime identification (30th/70th/90th percentiles)
- Enhanced info ratio calculation
- Economic significance filtering
- Adaptive threshold adjustments
- Interaction feature creation

## Key Validation Points

### 1. Mathematical Correctness
- ✅ Vol_risk = vol_raw² (variance calculation)
- ✅ Info ratio = |Q50| / sqrt(market_variance + prediction_variance)
- ✅ Regime thresholds at correct percentiles
- ✅ Interaction features = regime_flag × Q50

### 2. Economic Logic
- ✅ Transaction cost filtering (5 bps = 0.0005)
- ✅ Economic significance = expected_value > transaction_cost
- ✅ Adaptive thresholds based on market regimes
- ✅ Risk-adjusted signal quality

### 3. Signal Generation
- ✅ Q50-centric directional logic
- ✅ LONG when tradeable & Q50 > 0
- ✅ SHORT when tradeable & Q50 < 0
- ✅ HOLD when not tradeable
- ✅ Signal consistency validation

### 4. Regime Awareness
- ✅ Low volatility: 30% threshold reduction
- ✅ High volatility: 40% threshold increase
- ✅ Extreme volatility: 80% threshold increase
- ✅ Momentum regime identification

### 5. Performance & Robustness
- ✅ Fast execution (< 1 second for 1000 observations)
- ✅ Memory efficient (< 10x input size)
- ✅ Handles edge cases without errors
- ✅ Parameter sensitivity validation

```

## Integration with Actual System

### For Production Testing
To test against the actual training pipeline:
1. Replace mock function with actual `q50_regime_aware_signals` import
2. Install full dependencies (qlib, etc.)
3. Use real market data
4. Adjust test thresholds for production parameters

### Mock vs Real Function
The mock function preserves:
- ✅ Core mathematical relationships
- ✅ Signal generation logic
- ✅ Regime identification algorithms
- ✅ Economic filtering criteria
- ✅ Interaction feature creation

Differences from real function:
- Simplified expected_value calculation
- Reduced parameter thresholds for testing
- No external dependencies required
