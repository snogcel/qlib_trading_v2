# Feature Test Coverage System - Requirements

## Introduction

This feature will create a comprehensive test coverage system for all trading system features documented in the Feature Knowledge Template. The system will generate automated tests that validate feature behavior, economic hypotheses, performance characteristics, and failure modes across different market regimes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Feature Discovery and Parsing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically discover and parse all features from the Feature Knowledge Template, so that I can ensure comprehensive test coverage without manual tracking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL parse docs/FEATURE_KNOWLEDGE_TEMPLATE.md and extract all documented features
2. WHEN parsing features THEN the system SHALL capture feature names, implementations, economic hypotheses, and performance characteristics
3. WHEN a feature has multiple variants (e.g., vol_raw, vol_raw_decile) THEN the system SHALL treat each variant as a separate testable component
4. IF a feature lacks implementation details THEN the system SHALL flag it for manual review
5. WHEN parsing is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a feature inventory with test requirements

### Requirement 2: Economic Hypothesis Validation Tests

**User Story:** As a quantitative researcher, I want tests that validate the economic hypotheses behind each feature, so that I can ensure features behave according to their theoretical foundation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing Q50 THEN the system SHALL validate that it provides directional bias in trending markets
2. WHEN testing vol_risk THEN the system SHALL verify it captures variance-based risk measures correctly
3. WHEN testing sentiment features (fg_index, btc_dom) THEN the system SHALL validate they reflect market sentiment appropriately
4. WHEN testing Kelly sizing THEN the system SHALL verify risk-adjusted position sizing behavior
5. WHEN testing regime features THEN the system SHALL validate regime classification accuracy
6. IF a feature's behavior contradicts its economic hypothesis THEN the system SHALL flag it as a validation failure

### Requirement 3: Performance Characteristics Testing

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want tests that verify each feature's performance characteristics match documented expectations, so that I can detect feature degradation or drift.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing core signal features THEN the system SHALL validate hit rates, Sharpe ratios, and regime dependencies
2. WHEN testing volatility features THEN the system SHALL verify empirical ranges and normalization behavior
3. WHEN testing position sizing features THEN the system SHALL validate risk-adjusted returns and drawdown control
4. WHEN performance metrics deviate from documented ranges THEN the system SHALL generate alerts
5. WHEN testing across different market regimes THEN the system SHALL validate regime-specific performance characteristics

### Requirement 4: Failure Mode Detection

**User Story:** As a risk manager, I want tests that actively probe for documented failure modes, so that I can detect when features are operating outside their safe parameters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing features THEN the system SHALL simulate documented failure conditions (low liquidity, regime transitions, data quality issues)
2. WHEN failure modes are triggered THEN the system SHALL verify the feature fails gracefully or provides appropriate warnings
3. WHEN testing vol_risk THEN the system SHALL verify it handles flat markets and synthetic volatility appropriately
4. WHEN testing Q50 THEN the system SHALL detect regime misclassification and whipsaw environments
5. IF a feature exhibits undocumented failure modes THEN the system SHALL log them for investigation

### Requirement 5: Feature Interaction Testing

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want tests that validate feature interactions and dependencies, so that I can ensure the system behaves correctly when features are combined.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing feature combinations THEN the system SHALL validate documented positive synergies (Q50 + spread, vol_risk + Kelly sizing)
2. WHEN testing feature interactions THEN the system SHALL detect negative interactions or conflicts
3. WHEN testing Q50 interactions THEN the system SHALL verify they enhance rather than degrade signal quality
4. WHEN features have documented dependencies THEN the system SHALL test the dependency chain
5. IF feature interactions produce unexpected results THEN the system SHALL flag them for review

### Requirement 6: Regime-Aware Testing

**User Story:** As a trading strategist, I want tests that validate feature behavior across different market regimes, so that I can ensure robust performance in varying market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing features THEN the system SHALL simulate bull, bear, sideways, high volatility, and low volatility regimes
2. WHEN testing in bull markets THEN the system SHALL validate which features perform best according to documentation
3. WHEN testing in bear markets THEN the system SHALL verify documented bear market performance characteristics
4. WHEN regime transitions occur THEN the system SHALL test feature stability and adaptation
5. WHEN testing regime multiplier THEN the system SHALL validate it adjusts appropriately across different market conditions

### Requirement 7: Implementation Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests that validate feature implementations match their documented specifications, so that I can ensure code correctness and prevent implementation drift.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing feature calculations THEN the system SHALL verify formulas match documented specifications
2. WHEN testing vol_risk THEN the system SHALL validate the variance calculation: Std(Log(close/Ref(close,1)), 6)^2
3. WHEN testing normalized features THEN the system SHALL verify normalization logic and ranges
4. WHEN testing temporal features THEN the system SHALL validate lag integrity and causality compliance
5. IF implementation deviates from specification THEN the system SHALL report the discrepancy

### Requirement 8: Test Report Generation

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want comprehensive test reports that summarize feature coverage and validation results, so that I can track system health and identify areas needing attention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive coverage report
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include pass/fail status for each feature and test category
3. WHEN features fail tests THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure analysis and recommendations
4. WHEN reporting on feature hierarchy THEN the system SHALL prioritize Tier 1 and Tier 2 feature issues
5. WHEN tests are run regularly THEN the system SHALL track trends and detect degradation over time

### Requirement 9: Automated Test Execution

**User Story:** As a CI/CD engineer, I want the test system to integrate with automated workflows, so that feature validation can be part of continuous integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrated with CI/CD THEN the system SHALL run feature tests automatically on code changes
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and notify relevant stakeholders
3. WHEN running in CI THEN the system SHALL complete within reasonable time limits (< 10 minutes for core tests)
4. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL update test coverage metrics and reports
5. IF test infrastructure fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery guidance

### Requirement 10: Extensibility and Maintenance

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want the test system to be easily extensible and maintainable, so that I can add new features and update tests as the system evolves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new features are added to the template THEN the system SHALL automatically include them in test coverage
2. WHEN feature specifications change THEN the system SHALL update corresponding tests
3. WHEN adding custom test logic THEN the system SHALL provide clear extension points
4. WHEN maintaining tests THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation and examples
5. IF the feature template format changes THEN the system SHALL adapt gracefully or provide clear migration guidance
