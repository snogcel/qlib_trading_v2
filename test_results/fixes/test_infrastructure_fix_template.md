## Test Quality Issues

### Economic Hypothesis Testing
**Issue**: Low success rate in economic hypothesis tests

**Recommended Actions:**
- [ ] Review economic assumptions in test cases
- [ ] Update test criteria based on current market conditions
- [ ] Validate statistical significance thresholds
- [ ] Create more robust hypothesis testing framework

### Performance Testing
**Issue**: Performance tests failing across multiple features

**Recommended Actions:**
- [ ] Review performance benchmarks and thresholds
- [ ] Update performance criteria for current hardware
- [ ] Implement more granular performance metrics
- [ ] Add performance regression testing

### Regime Dependency Testing
**Issue**: Regime-specific tests showing inconsistent results

**Recommended Actions:**
- [ ] Validate regime classification accuracy
