- Address vol_risk failures (current rate: 60.0%)
- Performance optimization review across multiple features

### ðŸ“ˆ Long-term Improvements
- Implement automated regression testing for fixed issues
- Enhance test data quality and coverage
- Develop feature-specific monitoring and alerting
- Create comprehensive feature documentation and test specifications
- Establish regular feature health check procedures

## Action Plan

### Phase 1 Critical
**Timeline**: 1-2 days

**Actions:**
- 1. Emergency investigation of btc_dom complete failure
- 2. Check btc_dom data source connectivity and availability
- 3. Review btc_dom implementation for fundamental errors
- 4. Run isolated btc_dom tests with debug logging
- 5. Fix critical btc_dom issues and verify with test suite

**Success Criteria:**
- btc_dom achieves >50% test success rate
- All btc_dom critical priority tests pass
- Root cause of btc_dom failure identified and documented

### Phase 2 High Priority
**Timeline**: 1 week

**Actions:**
- 1. Analyze regime_multiplier and vol_risk failure patterns
- 2. Review regime dependency logic across both features
- 3. Validate economic hypothesis testing for both features
- 4. Fix performance issues in vol_risk and regime_multiplier
- 5. Update test criteria based on current market conditions

**Success Criteria:**
- regime_multiplier achieves >80% test success rate
- vol_risk achieves >80% test success rate
- All critical priority tests pass for both features

### Phase 3 Systematic
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

**Actions:**
- 1. Comprehensive review of economic hypothesis testing methodology
- 2. Regime detection system validation and improvement
