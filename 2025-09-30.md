## Test Data Generation

### Realistic Market Data Fixture
The test suite uses a sophisticated data generation approach:

```python
# Volatility regime simulation
base_vol = np.random.uniform(0.005, 0.02, n)
vol_regime_factor = np.random.choice([0.5, 1.0, 2.0], n, p=[0.7, 0.2, 0.1])
vol_raw = base_vol * vol_regime_factor

# Q50 correlation with volatility regimes
q50_base = np.random.normal(0, 0.008, n)
q50 = q50_base * vol_regime_factor * 0.5  # Stronger signals in high vol

# Spread correlation with volatility
spread_base = np.random.uniform(0.01, 0.03, n)
spread = spread_base * vol_regime_factor
```

- ✅ Adaptive thresholds based on market regimes
- ✅ Risk-adjusted signal quality

### 3. Signal Generation
- ✅ Q50-centric directional logic
- ✅ LONG when tradeable & Q50 > 0
- ✅ SHORT when tradeable & Q50 < 0
- ✅ HOLD when not tradeable
- ✅ Signal consistency validation

### 4. Regime Awareness
