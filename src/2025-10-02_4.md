Yes, a 2.64 Sharpe ratio is possible, though it is considered very good to excellent
. A Sharpe ratio over 2 is rarely seen in consistently performing strategies over the long term, making it an impressive result. 
What a 2.64 Sharpe ratio signifies
The Sharpe ratio measures an investment's risk-adjusted return by comparing its excess returns (returns above the risk-free rate) to its volatility. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates a better return for each unit of risk taken. 
A Sharpe ratio of 2.64 means that for every unit of volatility (or total risk) the fund experienced, it returned 2.64 units of excess return. To put this in perspective: 

    Good: A Sharpe ratio of 1.0 to 1.99 is considered good.
    Very Good: A ratio of 2.0 to 2.99 is very good.
    Excellent: A ratio of 3.0 or higher is considered excellent. 

Factors affecting the Sharpe ratio
Several factors can influence the size of a Sharpe ratio.

    Risk-free rate: A lower risk-free rate will mathematically increase the Sharpe ratio, all else being equal. Conversely, a higher risk-free rate will decrease it.
    Time horizon: While a fund may achieve a high Sharpe ratio over a short period, sustaining that performance over a long period (e.g., 5 or 10 years) is much more difficult.
    Use of leverage: Using leverage can increase both returns and volatility. It can artificially inflate a Sharpe ratio in a winning strategy, but it also magnifies losses.
    Lack of normal distribution: The ratio's mathematical basis assumes returns are normally distributed. If a strategy's returns do not follow a normal distribution, the Sharpe ratio may be misleading. 

Potential caveats of a very high Sharpe ratio
While a high Sharpe ratio is desirable, investors should exercise caution and investigate the source of such high performance.

    Data fudging: A Sharpe ratio can be manipulated, for example, through short-term "backtesting" that does not reflect real-world trading costs and limitations.
    Hidden risks: A high Sharpe ratio could result from strategies that generate small, consistent returns for long periods but carry a small possibility of large, catastrophic losses. This is sometimes called "picking up pennies in front of a steamroller".
    Unusual market conditions: The Sharpe ratio can be influenced by specific market conditions. An outstanding ratio may not be repeatable if the market environment changes.
